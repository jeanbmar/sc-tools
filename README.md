# SC Tools

This module is intended to unpack, repack and edit `.sc` files from Supercell games.

The project is a few years old and needs to be refactored, apologies for the code mess. I'll take care of it soon.

SWF objects structures are still pretty accurate though. 

What you are looking for should be in `lib/schemas/tags`.

Todo:
- Convert to ESM
- Add engine web example
- Host test files in a github release
- Add back tests
- Replace @rushb private dependencies with public dependencies
- Quick refactoring
- Publish to NPM
- Check sc compression perf
- Update readme
